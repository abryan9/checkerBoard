# UWIT checkerBoard #
Welcome to the all-in-one interface for Room Check management!

## Goals ##
Users should be able to open the CheckerBoard application, select their zone, and see an up-to-date list of the rooms in their zone, when they were last checked/if they need checked again, and their availability.
Accomplishing this is dependant upon having ready access to the current tracking systems (namely LSM and 25Live) and proper implementation of all dependencies.

## TO-DO ##
- [ ] Create an application interface
- [ ] Data storage/zoning
- [ ] Updating the system with fresh information
