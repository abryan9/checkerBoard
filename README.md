# UWIT checkerBoard #
Welcome to the all-in-one interface for Room Check management!

## Goals ##
Users should be able to open the CheckerBoard application, select their zone, and see an up-to-date list of the rooms in their zone, when they were last checked/if they need checked again, and their availability.
Accomplishing this is dependant upon having ready access to the current tracking systems (namely LSM and 25Live) and proper implementation of all dependencies.

## Known Issues ##
* Resizing the window is very clunky
* No LSM integration

## Install instructions ##
### Windows ###
To install on Windows, simply run the install.py file by double clicking on it or executing it in Command Prompt

### Linux ###
Currently, there is no readily available distribution for Unix devices, but the app can still be downloaded and run 
by executing the checkerBoard.py file in checkerBoard/src
